    "### API: Airport weather\n",

    "For this question, we will be using requests library to request\n",

    "\n",
    "*How to decide whether the airport is cloudy or not?*  \n",
    "We check if the ```shortForecast``` field has the word ___cloudy___ for the next time period. Forecasts such as _mostly cloudy_ or _partly cloudy_ count as cloudy. It will be a two-step process to obtain the value for ```sortForecast```: the first API request will include a URL that, when called, contains the ```shortForecast``` that we are after.\n",

    "Q. I got something after requesting, but, I am not sure, what it is.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Q. How do I get information from this json?  \n",
    "A. For getting info from that, as taught in the class, you can simply index them by using keys that you want after assessing the json.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Okay, I indexed the json using the keys and I get some list out of it. What is that?  \n",
    "A. That list is the forecast for the next hours. You'll need this information for making the decision that is required in the question. Also, what you are getting in the list is a dict. **Make sure you understand what you are dealing with at each point.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Should I use the plain *forecast* or *forecastHourly*?\n",
    "A. Please use the plain *forecast*."
